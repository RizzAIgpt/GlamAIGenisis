# Pantone Color Systems – For Coatings + Pigments

#### Our Fashion, Home + Interiors (FHI) Color System also has broad uses in hard goods, paints, leather goods, cosmetics & beauty, and other pigment-based design applications.

### At the Heart of Product Design is Pantone’s Lacquered Coating

Designed to show the appearance of color on product, lacquered coating is the tool for understanding the achievability of color for paint, coatings, pigment, textile and leather applications. In addition, Pantone Lacquer Coated paper products can be used for specifying, communicating and developing colors from our Fashion, Home + Interior system in other, non-textile applications.

### Understanding the Suffix

You will see two suffixes in use among our FHI products for coatings and pigments:

- **TPG** – Lacquer coated visual representation of our FHI Textile Cotton (TCX) system
- **TPM** – Visual representation of 200 metallic finishes

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1: How do you select the colors for the FHI system?

In today’s complex and challenging marketplace, color is often that catalyst that sparks the sale,
defines the space, and creates the mood. We select colors for the FHI system based on three important
and distinct criteria. First, our global team of color trend forecasters look at the movement of color
trends to ensure your palettes are fresh, modern, and relevant. Of course, we also understand the
importance of core colors and the integral role they play in building your seasonal color stories.
Therefore, we look at the color needs of the industries we serve and those we would like to better
impact to ensure a comprehensive set of core and trend shades. Lastly, we only select colors that are
easily achievable and reproducible, for greater usability and efficiency.

#### 2: How is Pantone's lacquer coating on paper produced?

Our FHI paper products use a nitrocellulose coating on paper developed through a pigment formulation. FHI
Color Guide and Color Specifier are matched against the Pantone Cotton Swatch Card, the standard for
color consistency. Colors are visually evaluated and also measured using a 45 degree viewing angle under
controlled lighting.

#### 3: Can the Textile Paper Guide (TPG) be used for textile applications?

To ensure the closest visual match, we recommend using the material format that is closest to your end
use application. We recommend our textile cotton products (TCX) for all fabric applications. Because
each material takes color differently, the same color in cotton, plastic, and on lacquered paper can
vary slightly.

#### 4: When do I use the lacquered coating vs textile product?

Use lacquered coating for product applications that require a coated finish or are developed with colored
pigments. Use our textile products when working with fabric applications that require dye formulations,
supported by spectral data and dyestuff recipes.

#### 5: How does the naming convention work for FHI colors?

Each FHI System color has a unique name and number, such as in 15-1247 Tangerine. That color is then
differentiated across materials through a unique suffix.

For lacquered coatings, the color would be noted as 15-1247 TPG Tangerine.

For cotton, it would be noted as 15-1247 TCX Tangerine.

And, for plastics, it would be noted as PQ 15-1247 TCX Tangerine.

For lacquered coating, the suffix TPG stands for ‘Textile Paper Green’. This suffix replaced the TPX
system in 2015 by reformulating the colors to meet international environmental standards.

If you are still using the TPX system, it is time to upgrade to the TPG system.

#### 6: Why should you update your Pantone Guides & Books?

Over time, paper will yellow and inks & dyes will fade. Handling, light, humidity, and oil will cause
colors to become inaccurate. Plus, you could be missing the latest market and trend driven colors.

#### 7: Which Product Is Right For Me?

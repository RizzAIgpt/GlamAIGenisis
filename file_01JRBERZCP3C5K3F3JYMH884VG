Sketch, draw and design in Pantone colors with Talens \| Pantone markers! These high-quality markers contain pigmented, water-based ink in vivid colors based on the Pantone Matching System. Meticulously formulated, adjusted and tested by Talens, co-designed and approved by Pantone.

Bring your ideas to life and discover the possibilities! Each marker features two nibs, offering the ultimate flexibility: a brush tip for details and fine lines, and a chisel tip for broad strokes and bold color blocks. The ink dries quickly and is waterproof when dry, which makes it perfect for layering.

Use the colors with our unique Talens \| Pantone paper for an optimal match with Pantone colors. When your marker runs out of ink, refill it using Talens \| Pantone marker ink in the same color!

This set contains 9 Talens \| Pantone markers and comes in a sturdy box with a sleek, horizontal design, ensuring your markers are always ready to use with optimal ink flow to both nibs. Thanks to the color names and numbers on the caps, you can easily pick the right color for your work.

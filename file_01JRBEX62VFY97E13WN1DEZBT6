In ARISE we explore ways in which design, fashion, art, and other creative forms reflect on the human condition. Color plays a significant role during this journey, speaking to us through memory and constantly influencing our feelings. Deeply colored browns and greens underline our need for roots and a human connection with nature while sumptuous shades of teal and purple, vibrant emeralds and maroons, evoke palettes of bygone eras and centuries past. Designing for neurodiversity we look to dusted and muted hues that calm and balance while pale and vaporized pinks and blues bring a cooling touch to the future.

VIEWPOINT COLOUR reflects current and future market conditions with an approach that aims to balance the informative and insightful with the inspirational and innovative. We carefully analyze consumer behavior, socio-economic developments, cultural trends, and lifestyle; we put color and design into perspective, confirm emerging directions, monitor, and reconfirm maturing ideas to arrive at sound conclusions and color and design strategies for decision-makers in the fields of textiles, fashion, beauty, graphics, architecture, interior and industrial design.

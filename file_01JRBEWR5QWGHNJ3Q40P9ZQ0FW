In HUMAN NATURE we explore the inspirational nature of our relationship with the natural world and the colors that merge us with the animal kingdom. We embrace the golds and browns of fake animal skins and furs, the changeant shades of mollusks, crustaceans, and beetles, and the splendid brights of terrestrial birds. AI imagines an in¬congruously beautiful multi-colored world where man, nature, and machine all combine in new ways to live in harmony. Celebrating and respecting diversity and bio-inclusive culture, we recognize nature as a living entity fundamental to our survival and the importance of creating a harmonious collaboration with all life on earth.

VIEWPOINT COLOUR reflects current and future market conditions with an approach that aims to balance the informative and insightful with the inspirational and innovative. We carefully analyze consumer behavior, socio-economic develop¬ments, cultural trends, and lifestyle; we put color and design into perspective, confirm emerging directions, monitor, and reconfirm maturing ideas to arrive at sound conclusions and color and design strategies for decision-makers in the fields of textiles, fashion, beauty, graphics, architecture, interior and industrial design.

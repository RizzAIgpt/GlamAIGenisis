Toe to heel, NAIOCA is 100% vegan, made with heavy-duty organic canvas, and ethically sourced natural rubber.

Inspired by the feeling of walking barefoot in the grass, we custom-designed our insoles to provide all-day comfort and support.

**STANDARD shipping takes about 5-6 business days to arrive.**

Our standard return window is **60 days**! Returns and exchanges are accepted if your sneakers are: **Unworn**, **Unwashed**, and **In the original packaging**

When trying on your CARIUMAs for the first time (to test fit & comfort), please make sure to only wear them inside on a clean floor. If you plan to return them (or think there’s a slight chance you might need to exchange them), we ask that you refrain from wearing them outside. This eliminates the possibility of dirt, grime, etc. We cannot accept any sneakers that have been worn down, disheveled, washed or altered in any way.

# PANTONEVIEW Colour Planner Spring/Summer 2022 PDF

## Connection: A Union of Calm and Healing Color with a Rainbow of Hope and Joy

The PANTONEVIEW Colour Planner Spring/Summer 2022 lifestyle color trend forecast offers seasonal inspiration, key color directives, suggested color harmonies plus material and product application across menswear, womenswear, active, color cosmetics, interior, industrial and multi-media design 24 months ahead of the season.

Color for Spring/Summer 2022 expresses a sense of duality with apparent opposites coming together in solid and tonal statements as well as more radical color contrasts. The appeal of familiar timeless neutrals, spiritual lilacs, mineral tones and softer pastels coexists with our desire for natures blues and greens, warming terracotta shades, dynamic reds and sunny yellows. Our embrace of these seasonless and enduring shades encourages personal expression, from the sensible to the outrageous, while simultaneously inspiring by helping us to connect to color in a more mindful way.

All Trend Forecasting books are non-returnable/non-refundable.

For Spring/Summer 2025 we take on a new consciousness embodied in symbiotic relationships between humanity, fauna, and the planet, alliances further enabled through our relationship with Generative AI. AI amplifies our ability to tackle complex challenges and imagine a new way of living with the world around us. As we seek refuge and connectiveness in nature, we discover that the most essential things are in fact, the most primal ones. Colors for Spring/Summer 2025 capture this awareness, from essential marbled whites and grays to savannah greens and browns, to complementary watery, shimmery and sky like blues. Palettes span from the most classic neutrals to the most innovative of backlit brights, reflecting an essential bond between humans, animals, and fauna. This alliance is cherished as we sync with AI, creating a harmonious balance between technology and nature.

An elegant special-edition design inspired by and created with the 77 Monochromatic Shadows from Pantone’s new Fashion, Home + Interiors Dualities palette, interpreted across mixed media to give layers and depth. The glistening night scene symbolizes tranquil closures, grounded in the Japanese concept of _ikigai_, or happiness through balance.

**Materials:** 100% merino with a baby herringbone pattern, hand zardozi embroidery, hand painting, sequins, a play of stitches—satin, running, and blanket—chenille thread, French knots, crystals, and caviar beads with ombré dyed fringe detail.

**Dimensions:** 27-inch x 80-inch

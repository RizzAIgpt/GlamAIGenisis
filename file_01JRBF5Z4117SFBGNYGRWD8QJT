Thank you for using the PANTONE Help Center.

#### What do the TC/TCX and TP/TPX suffixes mean?

The suffix "TP" stands for "Textile Paper,"\* and the suffix "TC" stands for "Textile Cotton." \*Both are designators from the PANTONE TEXTILE Color System. There are slight differences between the paper and fabric versions of the System. However, for CAD applications, the differences should be minor. A note of caution: When specifying your color choices to a mill or manufacturer, be sure to specify and conduct all approvals from either the TC or TP\* version of PANTONE FASHION + HOME.

\*In the latest versions of the PANTONE FASHION + HOME product line, the paper edition product carries a suffix of TPX = textile paper edition, extended range. \*The cotton editions carry a suffix of TCX = textile, cotton edition, extended range. This is to differentiate the newest product from older editions.

#### What is the difference between PANTONE TEXTILE Color System and PANTONE FASHION + HOME?

In 2003 we changed the name of the PANTONE TEXTILE COLOR System to the PANTONE FASHION + HOME. This change was made in order to provide our clients with a better understanding as to which of our systems were appropriate for their marketplace.

Enhancements to this product line which includes 1,925 colors are the following:

A) 196 new colors

B) Colors are arranged chromatically by color family. This makes it easier than ever to locate the ""perfect blue,"" or the ""exact shade of red"" needed for a particular project.

C) New cotton formats such as the cotton selector, cotton swatch set and cotton passport have been added

D) Developed a relationship with Clariant resulting in consistent reproducible color that will allow dye mills to dramatically reduce color development lead times.

E) The paper edition product have been produced in a larger size for improved visualization.

## Metallics

#### What is the difference between PANTONE Metallics and PANTONE Premium Metallics?

PANTONE Metallics dates from the mid-1980's. The colors are formulated using seven basic metallic inks which contain metal flake, which leafs to the surface as the ink dries to create the metallic effect. This 'leafing characteristic' can vary from job to job, leading to inconsistencies in the final printed result. Further, the metallic colors also use certain of the PANTONE Basic Colors which are chemically incompatible with UV coatings, and it is common to use coatings to improve the lasting power of the printed matter.

PANTONE Premium Metallics addresses both of these issues. The colors are formulated using a specialized non-leafing silver, the pigment coming from Eckart, and also use basic inks that are fully UV-compatible.

PANTONE Metallics and PANTONE Premium Metallics colors are unique and are not intended to be interchangeable.

#### How do I identify PANTONE metallic and pastel colors?

PANTONE Colors which are four-digits beginning with 8, e.g., PANTONE 8960 C, are metallic colors found in the following product:

PANTONE metallic formula guide coated http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=218&ca=1

PANTONE metallic chips coated http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=219&ca=1

Colors beginning with '9', as in PANTONE 9201 C, are found in the following pastel products:

PANTONE pastel formula guide coated + uncoated http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=217&ca=1

PANTONE pastel chips coated + uncoated http://www.pantone.com/pages/products/product.aspx?pid=220&ca=1

(Note: Links provided are from the North American Web site; please consult your local Pantone office for availability in areas outside of North America).

Support for the PANTONE Metallics coated library, and PANTONE Pastels coated and uncoated libraries, is contained in most updated graphics programs, including the latest versions of the Adobe Creative Suite applications, Macromedia FreeHand, QuarkXPress and others. However, Pantone has added 97 additional PANTONE Metallic Colors and 28 additional PANTONE Pastel Colors with the release of the latest versions of the above publications. Support for these added colors is provided by the Adobe Creative Suite 3 applications. If you are running earlier versions of the Adobe products, or software from other manufacturers, you may download the attached Excel spreadsheet that will provide you with sRGB and HTML data for these 97 added PANTONE Metallic Colors and 28 added PANTONE Pastel Colors, allowing these colors to be used within your software application programs.

#### What is the difference between PANTONE Metallics Coated and PANTONE Premium Metallics Coated?

The PLUS SERIES PREMIUM METALLICS is an all-new range of 300 metallic colors that have greater brilliance and can be easily coated without any loss in luster. PREMIUM METALLICS also have a longer life after printing without tarnishing or belmishing. Further, the PREMIUM METALLICS use pigments with small metallic particles fully suspended within the body of the ink, eliminating inconsistencies of luster that can occur with conventional inks due to the 'leafing' of the metallic flake to the surface as the ink dries.

#### What is the difference between PANTONE Silver 10077 and PANTONE 877?

PANTONE 877 C is the silver base used to blend the 'conventional' PANTONE Metallic colors, which have existed since the mid-to-late 1980's.

PANTONE Silver 10077 C is the specialized, non-leafing silver base manufactured by Eckart and used to formulate the PANTONE Premium Metallic colors, which were introduced in May 2010 with the PANTONE PLUS SERIES upgrade.

'Conventional' metallic base colors contain metal flake, which leafs to the surface as the ink dries to produce the metallic effect. The extent of this 'leafing characteristic' can vary depending on the length of time it takes for the ink to dry. This can lead to inconsistencies in the appearance of the colors from run to run.

Within the PANTONE Silver 10077 ink, the metallic particles are evenly dispersed within the vehicle of the ink, thereby removing this 'leafing characteristic' and leading to more consistently repeatable results.

#### What is the difference between the PANTONE METALLIC Formula Guide, and PANTONE METALLICS Coated?

The PANTONE METALLIC Formula Guide is now known as METALLICS Coated. The cover design, copy pages and page number graphics on the pages have been modified to be consistent with the rest of the PANTONE PLUS SERIES products. However, there have been no changes to the color palette, organization of the colors, or formulas.

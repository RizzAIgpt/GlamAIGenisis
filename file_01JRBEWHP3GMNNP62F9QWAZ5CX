Elegantly simple, the OCA Low is a refined take on Rio’s street and beach culture. Perfect for exploring the city or lounging by the beach, this is one of our most versatile sneakers.

Handcrafted using a robust canvas, the OCA Low Canvas exists at the intersection of functionality and style. With our 100% vegan insoles made from organic mamona oil and cork, it ensures optimal comfort and fit. The OCA Low boast a unique cap toe design and a fully-stitched lightweight outsole for a durable, long-lasting shoe.

Finishing our OCA Low sneakers with debossed metal aglets...it’s all in the details!

**STANDARD shipping takes about 5-6 business days to arrive.**

Our standard return window is **60 days**! Returns and exchanges are accepted if your sneakers are: **Unworn**, **Unwashed**, and **In the original packaging**

When trying on your CARIUMAs for the first time (to test fit & comfort), please make sure to only wear them inside on a clean floor. If you plan to return them (or think there’s a slight chance you might need to exchange them), we ask that you refrain from wearing them outside. This eliminates the possibility of dirt, grime, etc. We cannot accept any sneakers that have been worn down, disheveled, washed or altered in any way.

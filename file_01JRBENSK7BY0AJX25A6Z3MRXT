For the first time, designers working in plastic can get a complete set of 1,755 Pantone (PMS) colors as plastic standards.

Organized into three carousel towers that rotate for easy color location and replacement, the Pantone (PMS) Plastic Standard Chips Collection includes a large-size (3” x 1-7/8”) polypropylene chip for every color in the system. These plastic standards allow for precise color specification and matching, providing maximum creativity and control in the development of plastic products, including toys, consumer electronics, home furnishings, appliances, accessories, and more.

This collection provides designers with a wide selection of high-demand colors, and also affords the ability to cross match plastic designs with Pantone Colors for graphics and packaging. Each of the six tiers in the carousel is modular, so the desired tray can be easily removed, allowing for work with a specific color grouping.

Remove the limitations from your design process by enabling precise color communication and control of color in plastics throughout the color development process. Polypropylene chip material closely aligns with common real-world production materials, ensuring accurate color reproduction in your product across multiple plastic substrates. The included pigment formulation combines with the physical chip for the most accurate standard combination.

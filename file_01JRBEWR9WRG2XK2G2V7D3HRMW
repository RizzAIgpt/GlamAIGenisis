The PANTONEVIEW Colour Planner Autumn/Winter 25/26 color trend forecast offers seasonal inspiration, key color directives, suggested color harmonies plus material and product application across menswear, womenswear, activewear, cosmetics, interior, industrial and multi-media design 24 months ahead of the season.

Families visually unify individuals together to create a feeling of shared belonging. This idea of a blended group of linked yet disparate elements is explored in our color palettes for Autumn/Winter 2025/2026. Merging the familiar with the new, darker, stable rooted shades are contrasted with fresh, acidic yellows, whites, and pastels, while well-loved sporty tones are unexpectedly juxtaposed with young, lively, friendly hues. Duality and duplexity, just like a family are at the roots of the Autumn/ Winter season.

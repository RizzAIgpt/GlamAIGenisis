**PANTONE Tints and Tones Collection is a set of 100 best-selling whites, grays, and blacks, selected from the PANTONE GRAPHICS and the PANTONE FASHION, HOME + INTERIORS Color Libraries.**

This carefully curated range of cool and warm shades provides designers working in plastic with a wide selection of high-demand “neutral” colors, and also affords the ability to cross match plastic designs with PANTONE Colors for textile products, graphics, and packaging.

The collection is organized in an attractive carousel that conveniently rotates for easy color location and chip replacement.

These large-size (3” x 1-7/8”) polypropylene chips removes the limitations from your design process by enabling precise color communication and control of color in plastics throughout the color development process. Polypropylene chip material closely aligns with common real-world production materials, ensuring accurate color reproduction in your product. Corresponding pigment formulation combines with the physical chip for the most accurate standard combination.

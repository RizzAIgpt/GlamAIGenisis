## General Pantone

#### Can I obtain a chip page of a single PANTONE color?

This would be available from Pantone on a custom basis. Please visit http://www.pantone.com/products/products.asp?idArea=10 for more information about our Custom Color Services.

#### How can I obtain a PANTONE guide for our design library, at my interior design firm?

Pantone does not provide color samples on a complimentary basis. Unlike paint manufacturers who derive revenue from the sale of paint, Pantone’s main business and source of revenue is the sale of our color guides and books.

You are welcome to contact Pantone to discuss trade discount pricing for PANTONE products.

North American customers may call us at 1-888-800-9580 to reach a Direct Sales Representative for your area.

International customers should visit http://www.pantone.com/contact-us for contact information for your nearest Pantone office location.

#### Does Pantone define a tolerance for reproduction of PANTONE colors?

Pantone does not set tolerance levels for reproduction of PANTONE colors by commercial printers.

There are many variables that will effect final printed results. Some of these variables are indicated in the copy pages of the PANTONE guides. In many cases, organizations or large corporations will establish Light/Standard/Dark tolerance levels which are used as a QC benchmark for incoming materials.

Please keep in mind that Pantone, Inc. does not manufacture ink and all ink that is labled as a PANTONE Color is supplied by a licensed ink vendor and/or manufacturer.

#### How are the PANTONE guides printed?

The solid PANTONE Color Publications are printed in our facility in Carlstadt, New Jersey. We print on sheetfed equipment with a dry offset process, using specially modified equipment. Although we print dry offset to maintain the tightest possible control, the ink densities used are first tested using conventional wet offset plates, in order to best simulate conditions experienced by the average commercial printer. We print 28 individual spot colors to a form, with a separate key for the text printed in a second pass. Conventional offset printing inks are used.

#### How does PANTONE COLOR BRIDGE differ from the PANTONE FORMULA GUIDE?

PANTONE COLOR BRIDGE displays a side-by-side match between the PANTONE solid color on the left, and the closest CMYK simulation on the right. sRGB and HTML data is printed beneath the solid color, and CMYK values beneath the simulation. The product serves as a ‘bridge’ between solid color printing, CMYK printing and Web design; hence the title PANTONE COLOR BRIDGE. Guides are available individually on coated or uncoated paper, or as a two-guide set.

PANTONE FORMULA GUIDE displays the 18 basic PANTONE mixing colors, and then displays a palette of formulated colors using the base inks in varying proportions. Each color is displayed with the PANTONE reference number, and precise ink mixing formulas displayed as percentages by volume.

#### How can I match PANTONE colors in industrial coatings or paints?

Pantone has licensed Cardinal Industrial Finishes, a leading provider of both powder and liquid industrial coatings, to match PANTONE Colors in their product lines.

#### How can I specify white for printing purposes?

Although opaque white inks exist, Pantone does not provide a reference for white. Generally, if you are printing on white paper and apply no ink to an area, you will achieve white. When ink is needed, it should simply be specified as opaque white, without a PANTONE Reference.

#### How long has Pantone been in business?

Pantone was founded in 1963 by Lawrence Herbert. The world-famous PANTONE MATCHING SYSTEM® was first launched in that same year.

Pantone was acquired by X-Rite, Inc., in October 2007. Please click here to find out more about Pantone's history.

#### What does the PANTONE Trademank stand for?

PANTONE is Pantone, LLC's check-standard trademark for color reproduction and color reproduction materials.

The mission of PANTONE, LLC is to provide the community at large with the means to accurately specify, communicate, reproduce and control color wherever it is used. PANTONE Products span several industries, from printing/graphic arts, to interior design/architecture, to fashion, to product manufacturing.

#### What is the difference between ICC and ICM?

ICC = International Color Consortium, which is the body that created the standard for device profiling, and also the name for the standard itself. Profiles typically carry the .icc file extension on a Windows system.

ICM = Image Color Management, which is the color management module in Microsoft Windows operating system.

While the two terms are sometimes used interchangably, they really should not be . Some profiling software will make profiles with an .icm file extension. Should this be the case and the profile not be recognized by an application, simply changing the file extension to .icc can often solve the problem.

#### What is the 'trademark warning' brochure packaged with my product referring to?

The brochure that was packaged with your PANTONE Product deals with situations in which you wish to communicate a PANTONE Color together with its trademark identification. By 'trademark identification,' we simply mean the use of the PANTONE Trademark and the color reference number. An example of trademark identification is PANTONE 185 C. This is a typical example of how such a reference might be included:

'ABC corporation's corporate red is PANTONE 185 C'

In a situation like this, there is a tag line that is required to be included in published materials. This tag line would be provided by our Licensing Department upon request, and the finished copy must be reviewed by the Licensing Department prior to being disseminated. Please visit the 'contact us' page at pantone.com for a link to our Licensing Department.

In other situations, some companies want to include physical color samples in their corporate identity materials and identify the color sample as being equivalent to a PANTONE Color. In this case, the requirements are more stringent. Pantone would require that a Pantone Representative visit the printing site to ensure the accuracy of the color, at the client's expense, or Pantone can print the colors for you under our Corporate Identity Program. This is necessary to protect the integrity and viability of the PANTONE Trademark.

To sum up, it should be noted that the above requirements apply only when the PANTONE Trademark is to be displayed within a printed piece, e.g., brochure, advertisement, company corporate identity guidelines, etc. If you are merely specifying a color for a printer to use without actually displaying the PANTONE Trademark, then the requirements do not apply.

#### Why has Pantone removed the “edition” notation in the copy pages?

Editions are a common terminology used in the publishing industry to indicate an update to a publication. Over the years, Pantone used this to indicate a significant change to our product and often a change to the spectral data.

In 2010, Pantone established master spectral data for all future printings. That data was based on the measurements taken from the Pantone PLUS initial printing. This printing introduced our chromatic order and a new paper stock. All future printings are approved to this master spectral data; therefore, no edition terminology is needed.

In addition, we have eliminated all reference to the “printing” as this is no longer necessary. The edition and printing terminology have been replaced by a date coding system.

Due to handling, fading, and aging, your colors will appear inaccurate over time. That’s why we recommend on the back cover of each guide that they be replaced every 12-18 month, depending on your usage case and storage habits. This is understood to mean "from date of first use" and not "from date of manufacture."

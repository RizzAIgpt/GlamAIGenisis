In TRANSFORMATION, a new era brings radical changes in manufacturing, sustainability, and automation. Millennials and Gen Z are driving a whole new vibe, breaking free from traditional structures, craving experiences that bring joy. Let’s all escape the anxiety of today and embrace design that defies rules, where feeling is the new look, and color is used to deepen our connection to the world around us. The Winter 24/25 issue conveys a time for imagination, enchantment, and multiverse design that reshapes reality. Technology, especially AI, is both controversial and groundbreaking, influencing how color is developed, applied, and perceived, empowering designers, and sparking new creative frontiers. A new approach to color and design balances human ingenuity with the multiverse. Welcome to the era of TRANSFORMATION.

Edited by David Shah, VIEWPOINT COLOUR reflects current and future market conditions with an approach that aims to balance the informative and insightful with the inspirational and innovative. The content starts with the context behind each issue, then analysis of what is happening in the world of color. Current and future directional color is explored before moving on to a full presentation of the season’s palette. In the latter sections of our magazine we broaden our scope to investigate what's driving the world of art, interiors, and general design, as well as spotlighting the work of inspirational tastemakers.

# Shipping Policy

**How long will it take to receive my order?**

Most orders are shipped within 24 to 48 hours of receipt. Actual shipping time depends on the shipping method selected. FedEx Ground service normally takes 1 to 6 business days depending on the ship to location. Therefore, it can take 2 to 8 business days for you to receive your order (this is a combination of up to 6 business days transit time and 1 to 2 business days in our distribution facility).

Need it faster? You can choose FedEx 2nd Day Air or FedEx Next Day Air as your service. This will reduce your order's transit time to 2 business days for 2nd Day Air or 1 business day for Next Day Air.

**Overnight / Expedited Shipping to US Destinations**

Orders must be placed by **1:00pm ET weekdays** for same day shipping on FedEx Next Day or Second Day. Same day shipping applies to in-stock products only.

**Cariuma products shipping and return policies**

STANDARD shipping takes about **5-6** business days to arrive.

Our standard return window is **60 days**! Returns and exchanges are accepted if your sneakers are: **Unworn**, **Unwashed**, and **In the original packaging**.

When trying on your CARIUMAs for the first time (to test fit & comfort), please make sure to only wear them inside on a clean floor. If you plan to return them (or think thereâ€™s a slight chance you might need to exchange them), we ask that you refrain from wearing them outside. This eliminates the possibility of dirt, grime, etc. We cannot accept any sneakers that have been worn down, disheveled, washed or altered in any way.

The everlasting search for harmony filters through into every aspect of our lives including our relationships, the work we do, our social connections and the natural environment that surrounds us. Harmony in color unifies all the disparate elements of a product or design and helps ensure the right mood is being set. While the paths to harmony are many, they all center around our desire for balance and unity in our surroundings and the feeling of peace and cohesiveness it engenders. As we continue to redefine our style of living, harmony has taken on greater importance for our physical and spiritual well-being. PANTONE VIEW home + interiors 2025 provides you with directional color and design compositions from eco-inspired greens, carefree blues, earthy browns, and nurturing neutrals to cutting edge brights, utopian pastels, atmospheric purples, and elegant night shades, to help you create the visual interest and synchronized harmonious tone you are seeking.

## **FAQ**

#### How Does Pantone Choose the Paper for the Guides?

We print our colors on the most commonly used, globally available paper stocks. Our coated guide is #1 grade 100lb gloss text stock (148 g/m2) and the uncoated guide is premium grade 80lb text stock (118 g/m2).

#### What Is the Difference Between Coated (C) and Uncoated (U)?

PMS colors marked with a C mean that the color is printed on coated paper for a glossy finish, as you would see in a magazine. This is desirable for sharp and complex designs, as the ink stays on top of the paper, preventing bleeding. Likewise, a U indicates uncoated paper, which has a more porous finish, common on letterhead. Uncoated paper is generally more absorbent of ink than coated, reducing sharpness.

#### What's the Difference Between Spot Printing and Process Printing?

Understanding the difference between spot and process is incredibly important in setting color expectations from design intention to production and when transitioning from a computer screen to the printing press. Solid formulation, resulting in more precise colors and allowing for bold, vibrant colors.

Alternatively, process printing is a method of printing colors using Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK). In Extended Gamut printing, another form of process printing, Orange, Green, and Violet are added to the CMYK process to expand the color range.

#### Why Should You Update Your Pantone Guides & Books?

Handling, light, humidity, and paper aging will cause colors to become inaccurate and you could be missing the latest market and trend driven colors. How many colors are you missing?
